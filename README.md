## git

1. What is git?
   - git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of how files change over time and access previous version of files. It also allows you to have multiple versions of the same directory on multiple computers at the same time and with multiple people.
2. Why git?
   - It's used a lot in higher level courses and research. So knowing how to use it will benefit you. It's also open-source and doesn't rely on any single file type. You can track changes in folders of all different file types (though it works best with plain text files).
3. How git?
   - Typically git is used through a command line interface (CLI) but today you will learn how to use it with a graphical user interface (GUI). While git itself is open-source, there are online services that host your repositories and allow you to share them with the dier world. The most popular service is **GitHub**. If you do not already have a GitHub account, [click here](https://www.github.com) and sign up for an account. Then, [click here](https://desktop.github.com) and download **GitHub Desktop** for your operating system. This is the GUI that will allow you to run git commands from your local machine.
