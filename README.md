## git

1. What is git?
   - git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of how files change over time and access previous version of files. It also allows you to have multiple versions of the same directory on multiple computers at the same time and with multiple people.
2. Why git?
   - It's used a lot in higher level courses and research. So knowing how to use it will benefit you. It's also open-source and doesn't rely on any single file type. You can track changes in folders of all different file types (though it works best with plain text files).
3. How git?
   - Typically git is used through a command line interface (CLI) but today you will learn how to use it with a graphical user interface (GUI). While git itself is open-source, there are online services that host your repositories and allow you to share them with the dier world. The most popular service is **GitHub**. If you do not already have a GitHub account, [click here](https://www.github.com) and sign up for an account. Then, [click here](https://desktop.github.com) and download **GitHub Desktop** for your operating system. This is the GUI that will allow you to run git commands from your local machine.
  
### The Basics

1. Intializing a repository
   - Suppose you are starting a new project and want to keep track of all the files you will be using.
   - In this instance what you might want to do is first create a new directory on your local machine. Do that now and name it `[your name]_first_github_directory`.
   - Once you have done that, add a file to the directly called `notes.txt`. In the `notes.txt` file write a sentence or two about what you have learned so far today.
   - As of right now, this is just a "normal" folder on your machine. To make it a git-enabled folder and connect it with your GitHub account, open up GitHub Desktop and navigate to *Create New Repository...*. It will ask you for a few different things, but for now we only care about the **Name** and **Local Path**. For **Name** you can type "[your name]_first_github_directory" and for **Local Path** you should use the path to the folder you have just created. Make sure not to put the directory name itself, otherwise it will create a new directory within the one you just created.
   - Your repository is now set up. You have two options at this point:
     1. Keep adding/changing files
     2. Publish your repository
   - Publishing your repository makes it "official" on GitHub and will allow you to share it with others. You don't need to publish it right away, though, as it will still keep track of all the changes you make.
     
2. Cloning a repository
   - Suppose someone else has started a new project and you would like to join their repository.
   - In this instance what you want to do is *clone* the repository. There are a few different ways this can be done, but I'll show you only one.
   - This can happen in two steps:
     1. Obtain the repository's https link (e.g. `https://github.com/snelson89/DCD.git`)
     2. In GitHub Desktop, click *Clone Repository...*, navigate to URL, paste the link, and add a local path
   - To practice, clone my DCD repository to your local machine.
